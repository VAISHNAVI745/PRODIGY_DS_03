📊 Bank Marketing Prediction Dashboard

This project presents an interactive Streamlit dashboard powered by a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit. Using the Bank Marketing dataset, it uncovers key behavioral and demographic patterns that influence purchase decisions in marketing campaigns.

🔍 Key Objectives

Predict customer subscription based on personal and campaign-related features.
Analyze the influence of key variables such as job, marital status, education, and previous outcomes.
Visualize top features contributing to customer decisions.
Provide an easy-to-use interface for exploring model performance and insights.
📌 Key Features

📄 Dataset Preview: Displays a sample of the Bank Marketing dataset directly in the app.

📈 Model Accuracy: Computes and displays model accuracy and a detailed classification report.

🧠 Feature Importance: Interactive Plotly bar chart of the top 10 influential features in predicting outcomes.

🧪 Machine Learning Model: Decision Tree Classifier trained on a one-hot encoded version of the dataset with a depth limit of 5.

🎨 Streamlit UI: Responsive and user-friendly layout, expandable sections, and embedded visualizations.
